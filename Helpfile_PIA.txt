Usage: perl PIA.pl -f <file> -b <blast.txt> [options]

Main Arguments
Option	Description				Input		Explanation
	-f	FASTA or header filename	Y		FASTA of reads to PIA. Sequence names must be short enough for BLAST not to crop them.
	-b	BLAST filename			Y		BLAST filename containing entries for all reads in the FASTA (can contain other entries too).


Optional
Option	Description				Input		Explanation
 	-c 	cap				Optional	Maximum unique BLAST taxa examined. Impacts taxonomic diversity score. Default is 100.
	-C	min % coverage			Optional	Minimum percentage coverage a top BLAST hit must have for a read to be taken forward. Default is 95.
	-h	help				N		Print helpfile.
	-p	expected phylo range		Optional	Taxonomic ID that should encompass all reads in this sample, eg. "33208" for Metazoa or "2" for Bacteria. Helps assign BLAST hits when taxa share the same name.
	-s	min tax diversity score		Optional	Minimum taxonomic diversity score for a read to make it to Summary_Basic.txt. Depends on cap. Default is 0.1.

PIA.pl only (not PIA_inner.pl)
	-t	threads				Optional	Split the header file into x subfiles and run PIA_inner.pl on each one (default is 2).
